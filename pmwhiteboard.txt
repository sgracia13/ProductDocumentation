NOTES:

- Statement of Work (SOW) consists of:
	* Scope of Services
		The why and how of the deliverable
	* Acceptance Criteria
		Conditions under which feature can be 
		accepted. Consider QA and Testing processes
		per client. Ensure what is accepted is not 
		left for interpretation. 
	* Obligations, Assumptions and Dependencies
		Section describing/explaining to the client
		that they are of the understanding of all 
		things outlined in SOW. Commitment or "agreeing 
		to do this thing". Read Scope of Services
		section side by side. Are there still things
		that the client has agreed to reveal to us 
		during the project that we have accepted.

	* Fees and Compensation
		1. Type of contracts: Fixed Fee or Time & Materials
		2. Payment terms: Net10, Net30, Net60 (cadence)
		3. Payment schedule: invoice trigger (often tied to 
		sprints or weekly periods
		4. Total amount: Actualized total cost
	
- Reviewing a draft SOW:
	* Analyze Scope of Services and Obligations, Assumptions
	and dependencies sections heavily
	* Is everything actionable and deliverable with clear
	expectations?
	* Write feedback based on questions --> share to 
	sales/leadership in ops channel

- PM kicking off project where SOW has been signed already:
	* Question anything with PM lead/sales
	* Write down deliverables from scope of services
	* Write down assumptions and dependencies as 
	risk tracker (warning system)
	* UNDERSTAND THE FEES SECTION --> financial tracking
	in Harvest


- Submit Project Invoice:
	* Use executed of SOW for invoicing. Sometimes
	multiple versions of SOW draft are shared before
	it is signed.
- Create Invoice:
 	* Harvest --> Invoice --> New invoice --> Client Name -->
	Create blank invoice --> next
	Editing --> refer to doc

- Facilitate D&D Check Ins:
	1. Book meeting (ensure with design team you are not 
	meeting to frequently or infrequently)
	2. Ensure client team has authority to give direction 
	in call	
	3. Send designs to client team ahead of meeting for 
	review outside call time. Given.
	4. Prep with design team ahead of meeting
	5. Create doc for collaboration on notes and actions
	during meeting
		Facilitation:
			*Introduce topics to be discussed
			*Hand meeting over to designer to 
			present first topic
			*Keep convo on track
			*Close and mention sharing notes
		Follow up after meetings:
			*15-30 mins with design to discuss 
			feedback
			*review notes
			*send full recap to meeting group
		
- App Flow:
* remain consistent with color legend or shapes 
for easy digestion from anyone looking at it
* there is freedom to do them however you would like
as long as it is easily digestable and makes sense


- App Tear Down:

* Evaluate user onboarding experience --> What were the goals when 
designing the product/tradeoffs that were made
* Look into other functionalities --> How does it re-engage user
(push notifications, emails etc)
* UX paradigms it either adheres to or breaks
* Who will use this? Why?
* What hypotheses were at center of trying to achieve goal? 
* How do you measure success and will it be successful at all?
