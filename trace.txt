-- Trace project is experiencing an issue with production regarding orders 
and tasks pulling information (Outbound) --
* Well section database consumption order
* One of the outbound orders was not presenting (blank screen) 
* This project is already in production and has a testing and staging 
environment where this problem is not happening
(possible database issue)

* Use feature pushes for production
push instead of hot fixes after the fact (i.e. do not want 
to get to point of telling customer to uninstall and 
reinstall)

* Instead of using stepper for upload asset process, move toward only 
one form with steps in one screen with csv upload instead of manual

* Project Settings screen --> include Product ID

* Show warning sign before change to  (possible flow) product member type

* Can we show the whole product ID (cut spacing for 3 columns) (remember 
hover state exists)

* Truncation on drop down if product description/ID goes too long --> it
actually goes to the next line

* Uploading a new product, when I come to drop product ID down where 
is that data pulling from (would pull list straight from ITimS)

* Label for product vs product ID Project Settings page and new upload form (consistency)

--Assets Page-- 
* Archived vs Active pages (Could this be potentially confusing)
* IF we wanted to expand what an assets details page looks like 
(sliding sheet vs summary pointed page)
* Quick search 
* Tagging search vs multi search functionality
